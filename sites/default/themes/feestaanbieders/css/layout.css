 * Stark layout method
 *
 * To avoid obscuring CSS added to the page by Drupal or a contrib module, the
 * Stark theme itself has no styling, except just enough CSS to arrange the page
 * in a traditional "Header, sidebars, content, and footer" layout.
 *
 * This layout method works reasonably well, but shouldn't be used on a
 * production site because it can break. For example, if an over-large image
 * (one that is wider than 20% of the viewport) is in the left sidebar, the
 * image will overlap with the #content to the right. The exception to this
 * is IE6 which will just hide the navigation block completely in these
 * instances due to a positioning bug.
